# UBC Melee Leaderboard

This leaderboard tracks every entrant in a UBC melee tournament. UBC tournaments include UBC weeklies and UBC-hosted regionals like Janairy 2023.  

Tournament data is retrieved through the [start.gg api](https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro/). Elo is calculated using the standard chess elo formula. Read more [here](https://stanislav-stankovic.medium.com/elo-rating-system-6196cc59941e). Elo changes are halved for losers bracket sets.

Message @kaibiscus on discord if you don't want to be displayed on the leaderboard.
